# String Utilities

![Plugin functionality preview](preview.png)

This is a tiny plugin I wrote to start learning the Binary Ninja API.

**Warning: May be unstable on large databases.**

## Features

String Utilities isn't an extensive plugin, but it offers a few core features.
The main being the ability to automatically assign symbol names to strings -
either one at a time, or for the whole database at once. A maximum name length
and naming convention can be configured as desired.
